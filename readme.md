## Description ##

This plugin will perform a number of checks on your WordPress install to detect common configuration errors and known issues.

It currently checks your PHP and MySQL versions, some extensions which are needed or may improve WordPress, and that the WordPress.org services are accessible to you.

There is also a debug section, which allows you to gather information about your WordPress and server configuration that you may easily share with support personell for themes, plugins or on the official WordPress.org support forums.

In the future we may introduce more checks, and welcome feedback both through the [WordPress.org forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/health-check), and the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/WordPress/health-check).
